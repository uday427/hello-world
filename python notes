python notes :

list can contains different objects 
pop , discard add are common operations 
sort will not assign the sorted list , needed to write a separate line in order to assign to  it .


Dictionary are key value pairs . it is unordered and cannot be sorted
Dictinoaries can hold lists also  

Tuples are similar to list but they are immutable which means cannot be changed . they are represented inside parenthesis
 
 Sets are  unordered collection  o unique elements 
 Booleans only convey true or false
